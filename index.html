              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>
                  I am currently an Assistant Professor of <a href="https://www.pitzer.edu/academics/programs/mathematics">Mathematics</a> at Pitzer College. In 2024, I completed my Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam">Applied Mathematics</a> at Cornell University where I was fortunate enough to be co-advised by <a href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/francesca-parise">Francesca Parise</a> and <a href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/c-lindsay-anderson">Lindsay Anderson</a>. Prior to joining Cornell in 2018, I received my Bachelors degree in Mathematics from <a href="https://www.trincoll.edu/mathematics/">Trinity College</a>. My research leverages tools from network theory and dynamical systems to study emergent behavior in interconnected systems. Outside of research, I am passionate about teaching and have received graduate teaching awards from both the Department of Mathematics (2020) and the Department of Computer Science (2021) at Cornell University.
